It comprises of various charts showing:
1. Top 10 arrests in 2023
2. Arrests by borough and offense level
3. Arrests by month and race
4. Arrests by Jurisdiction code
5. Arrests by age group
6. Slicers based on offense level, sex and borough

 ## Analysis
The visuals show that the second quarter recorded the highest number of arrests followed by the third and first quarter.
From the charts, it can be concluded that the highest arrest made was in Brookyln with over 46,000 arrests while Staten Island has the least number of arrests. This is mostly because Staten Island is the least populated among the bouroughs in New York city.
The analaysis depicts the most of the people arrested are blacks with 82,035 arrests followed by the white hispanic. Out of the total number of people arrested, there are 2,481 people whose race is unknown.
